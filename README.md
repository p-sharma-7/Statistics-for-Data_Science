# Statistics for Data Science

Welcome to the **Statistics for Data Science** repository!  
This repository is a collection of foundational concepts, Python implementations, and practical examples in statistics aimed at building a solid base for data science and analytics.

---

## Objective

This repository serves as a personal learning space where I explore and apply fundamental statistical concepts that are essential in data science. The goal is to break down key topics—from descriptive stats to hypothesis testing—and understand how they connect with real-world data analysis. All examples and notebooks are written in Python to make the learning process more practical and hands-on.

# Statistics for Data Science

Welcome to the **Statistics for Data Science** repository! This project is a personal resource and portfolio where I explore the fundamental statistical concepts and their applications in data science using Python.

## Goal

The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate my foundational understanding of statistics through hands-on Python code, visualizations, and real-world datasets.
